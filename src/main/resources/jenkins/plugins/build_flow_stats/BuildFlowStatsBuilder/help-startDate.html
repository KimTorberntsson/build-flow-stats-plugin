<div>
    The Date should be written using the following format:
    YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm, such as for example 2014-07-28-13-29. This defines the earliest date that the 
    data will be collected from. After the initial data collection the script will collect 
    data from the previous date and time that the data was collected, until the current 
    date and time.
